# Reviews_sentiment_analysis
# Aim
The aim of this work is to use text mining and sentiment analysis to understand the feelings contained in the reviews of the tourist accommodation customers.
# Overview
This work uses the tourist accommodation review data [tourist_accommodation_reviews.csv](https://github.com/Olajydon/tourist_accommodation_reviews_sentiment_analysis/files/10895298/tourist_accommodation_reviews.csv)
set. The review dataset is a textual dataset that contains 53,644 reviews from 537 hotels/restaurants 
located in 25 different locations. Thus the dataset has 53,644 observations, each representing a customer’s experience. It’ll be a very difficult job for 
anyone to want to go through over 50k reviews in order to understand the feelings of these customers. This necessitates the use of a data mining technique 
to help mine these feelings.
